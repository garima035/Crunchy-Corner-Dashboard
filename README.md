# Crunchy-Corner-Business-Optimization-Budgeting
Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed Crunchy Corner's sales data using Power BI. I used both basic data processing techniques and advanced DAX formulas. I looked at important metrics like Net Profit, category performance, SKU, EBITDA, and Gross Profit. Additionally, I performed Pareto analysis, PVM, quadrant analysis, performance analysis, and cost analysis to provide useful insights for the business.

# Techniques and Tools Used ETL Techniques in Excel:
Filtering: First, I removed unnecessary information to clean the data. Data Cleaning: Then, I ensured the data was accurate and consistent.  VLOOKUP: Next, I used VLOOKUP to provide unique IDs for better data management. Data Modeling in Power BI: I created relationships between tables to integrate data effectively. Advanced Measure Statements in Power BI: DAX Formulas: I utilized DAX formulas to create advanced measures for calculating different profitability metrics. Visualizations: Then, I created charts and graphs to effectively display the data insights. Additional Tool: Power Query: Used in Power BI for data transformation and integration, which helped streamline data preparation before analysis.
